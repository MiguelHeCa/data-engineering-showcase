# Data Engineering Showcase
A compilation of notebooks and other materials to show my Data Engineering workflow.

## Structure

1. Notebook [Data Modelling](notebooks/Data_Modelling.ipynb) shows a small example of how is an ETL workflow inside a Data Warehouse to extract data from an Excel file, transform it and load it into a RDBMS and then connect the new data in a Dashboard aimed for the final user.
2. Notebook [API_retrieval](notebooks/API_retrieval.ipynb) uses an API from Eurostat to show how to extract information from an API, converting raw data into a json format and then transforming it to show it in tabular format.

The data can be consulted in directory `data/raw`
